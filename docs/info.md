## How it works

The project simulates and creates a gds file for a simple circuit F = AB + C'. It takes A, B, and C as inputs and returns an output F.

## How to test
Using the truth table below:

#25 A=0; B=0; C=0;
#25 A=0; B=0; C=1;
#25 A=0; B=1; C=0;
#25 A=0; B=1; C=1;
#25 A=1; B=0; C=0;
#25 A=1; B=0; C=1;
#25 A=1; B=1; C=0;
#25 A=1; B=1; C=1;

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
None!
